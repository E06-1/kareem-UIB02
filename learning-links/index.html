    <h3 id="venom">Venom</h3>
      <p>  I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed</p>
      <p>  When the world gives you a raw deal</p>
      <p>  Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"</p>
      <p>  When it talks to you like you don't belong</p>
      <p>  Or tells you you're in the wrong field</p>
       <p> When something's in your mitochondrial</p>
       <p> 'Cause it latched on to you, like—</p>
       <p> Knock knock, let the devil in</p>
        Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'</p>
       <p> This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"</p>
       <p> L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe</p>
       <p> Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago</p>
      <p>  Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'</p>
      <p>  Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent</p>
      <p>  Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa</p>
      <p>  Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants</p>
      <p>  And blew up my-my-myself again</p>
      <p>  Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin</p>
      <p>  Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin</p>
      <p>  Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik</p>
       <p> How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida</p>
      <p>  Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then</p>
      <p>  Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"</p>
      <p>  And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man</p>
      <p>  And I know they're gonna hate</p>
      <p>  But I don't care, I barely can wait</p>
      <p>  To hit 'em with the snare and the bass</p>
      <p>  Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced</p>
      <p>  Because they're gonna taste my—</p>
      <p>  Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum</p>
      <p>  And I'm not knowin' when I'm</p>
     <p>   Ever gonna slow up and I'm</p>
      <p>  Ready to snap any moment I'm</p>
      <p>  Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em</p>
      <p>  They ain't gonna know what hit 'em</p>
      <p>  (W-W-When they get bit with the—)</p>
      <p>  Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum</p>
      <p>  And I'm not knowin' when I'm</p>
      <p>  Ever gonna slow up and I'm</p>
      <p>  Ready to snap any moment I'm</p>
       <p> Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em</p>
       <p> They ain't gonna know what hit 'em</p>
       <p> (W-W-When they get bit with the—)</p>
       <p> I said knock knock, let the devil in</p>
       <p> Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen</p>
       <p> Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
       <p> It-it's evident I'm not done</p>
       <p> V-Venomous, the thoughts spun</p>
      <p>  Like a web and you just caught in 'em</p>
       <p> Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap</p>
       <p> Beat strangler attack</p>
      <p>  So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap</p>
       <p> Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track</p>
      <p>  Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick</p>
       <p> Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'</p>
       <p> Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel</p>
       <p> My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill</p>
       <p> With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin</p>
      <p>  Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)</p>
       <p> Translation, I will probably kill us both</p>
       <p> When I end up backin' into ya</p>
      <p>  You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya</p>
      <p>  When you're bit with the—</p>
      <p>  Venom, adrenaline momentum</p>
      <p>  And I'm not knowin' when I'm</p>
      <p>  Ever gonna slow up and I'm</p>
      <p>  Ready to snap any moment I'm</p>
      <p>  Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em</p>
      <p>  They ain't gonna know what hit 'em</p>
      <p>  (W-W-When they get bit with the—)</p>
      <p>  Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum</p>
     <p>   And I'm not knowin' when I'm</p>
      <p>  Ever gonna slow up and I'm</p>
      <p>  Ready to snap any moment I'm</p>
      <p>  Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em</p>
      <p>  They ain't gonna know what hit 'em</p>
      <p>  (W-W-When they get bit with the—)</p>
      <p>  I said knock knock, let the devil in</p>
      <p>  Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home</p>
      <p>  Ain't no telling when this chokehold</p>
      <p>  On this game will end, I'm loco</p>
       <p> Became a Symbiote, so</p>
      <p>  My fangs are in your throat, ho</p>
       <p> You're snake-bitten with my—venom</p>
      <p>  With the ballpoint pen I'm</p>
      <p>  Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot</p>
       <p> Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots</p>
      <p>  Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut</p>
      <p>  Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc</p>
      <p>  'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock</p>
       <p> Why the fuck not, you only get one shot</p>
      <p>  Ate shit 'til I can't taste it</p>
       <p> Chased it with straight liquor</p>
       <p> Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint</p>
       <p> And awake with a headache</p>
       <p> And I take anything in rectangular shape</p>
       <p> Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to</p>
       <p> 'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you</p>
       <p> So escapin' me is impossible</p>
       <p> I latch onto you like a—parasite</p>
       <p> And I probably ruined your parents' life</p>
       <p> And your childhood too</p>
       <p> 'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on</p>
       <p> I'm responsible for you retarded fools</p>
       <p> I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to</p>
       <p> You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you</p>
       <p> And I'm the suit, so call me—</p>
       <p> Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum</p>
       <p> And I'm not knowin' when I'm</p>
       <p> Ever gonna slow up and I'm</p>
       <p> Ready to snap any moment I'm</p>
       <p> Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em</p>
       <p> They ain't gonna know what hit 'em</p>
       <p> (W-W-When they get bit with the—)</p>
       <p> Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum</p>
        <p>And I'm not knowin' when I'm</p>
       <p> Ever gonna slow up and I'm</p>
       <p> Ready to snap any moment I'm</p>
        <p>Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em</p>
